## Webauthn.guide

### Registration

1. create credential
  - client retrieves publickKeyCredentialCreationOptions (pkcco) from server; state/challenge must be preserved on the server side
  - client/navigator calls authenticator with options to create credential
  - authenticator will create new credential and return an atestation response (new credential's public key + metadata)

2. register credential
  - attestation is packed; credential object is RO, ArrayBuffers must be casted to views (Uint8Array) before CBOR encoding
  - packed attestation is sent to the server for registration
  - server verifies the attestation and stores credential public key and association with the user

### Authentication

1. create assertion
  - client retrieves publicKeyCredentialRequestOption (pkcro) from server; state/challenge has to be preserved on the server side
  - client/navigator calls authenticator with options to generate assertion
2. authenticate (using) assertion
  - assertion is packed; credential is RO, ArrayBuffers must be casted to views (Uint8Array) before CBOR encoding
  - packed assertion is sent to the server for authentication
  - server validates the assertion (challenge, signature) against registered user credentials and performs logon process on success
